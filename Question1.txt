There is an irregular input from store 42, specifically user id: 607. They are making orders that are 1000 time larger than the average of the rest of the stores. This would not be strange if all order from store 42 were in similar amount. However, the average of the rest of the store fall in line with the other stores’ average. Additionally, all the orders made by 607 are the exact same amount with the exact time of 4:00:00. A couple of the orders are also made at the exact same time on the same day, which does not exist any were else in the data set. 

An additional outlier is store 78. This store seems to have a cost per shoe of $25 725. This is strange given the average of the other stores being $151.79. This can be easily fact checked and doesn’t seem as unusual compared to user 607’s orders, but will still affect overall metrics. 

A better way to evaluate this dataset would be to separate outliers from the data then calculate the average, which would be $754.09 for the AOV if we remove only the strange orders from user 607, and $302.58 if we remove store 78’s data. It would be better to separate store 78 because it accounts for over 50% of sales on its own for this month and as such should be evaluated on its own. 

However, this approach would be too manually intensive to weed out entries based on a gut feeling if they should be counted or not. An example would be a sale of 5 shoes from store 42 which is $1760. This looks like a large amount compared to the rest of the data, but a single sale is $352. Should store 42 be removed like store 78? A simpler way would be to remove outliers based on the data’s distribution. In order to do that we would take the first quantile and the third quantile and subtract them to obtain the interquantile range (IQR). Then we can eliminate any orders that exceed 1.5xIQR above the third quantile and below the first. In this case, only the numbers above would apply since the 1.5xIQR > first quantile. After this, we could then calculate a mean base on the remaining numbers. This would give a better overall indication of how well the all the store are doing.
